Patient Directory
=====================

Once you've loaded DBS Guide into Slicer (see :ref:`Installation`), you can
begin using DBS Guide. The first step is to load the patient's brain scans
as a directory or file (hence, the name Patient Directory). DBS Guide will 
take the directory that you load and make two new folders in your directory 
called ``scene`` and ``source``. ``source`` will contain the original brain
files/scans, while ``scene`` will contain all the new coregistered scans, 
settings and information.

We will load a sample directory called 'Sub-P115' in this tutorial. 


1. **Load the patient's directory.**
		An example directory is shown below. Notice, we only select the 
		patient directory/folder and not the files inside the folder.
		This directory contains folders in the ``.nii.gz`` format which
		means each folder is a gzipped folder of *NIFTI (Neuroinformatics
		Technology Initiative)* files. NIFTI files are files of MRI scans.

2. Select the options:
	**Implanted Sides**
		   Is the surgery unilateral or bilateral? Select left and right sides of 
		   the brain accordingly.
	**Rename Scans?**
		   This option is strongly recommended. In the ``source`` folder that DBS Guide 
		   creates, the new scans will have a different file extension will make a new folder 
		   in your directory with the coregistered scans once you've loaded them.
	**Use Previously Stored Values?**
		   This option is recommended.
		   If the patient directory had already been used in DBS Guide, you can load the directory
		   and the module will pick up right where you left off. 

		   Once you click ``Load Data``, the following screen will appear:

3. Select the right info: 
	Date
	Patient Name/ID
	Surgeon

Notice, there are two folders now in your patient directory:
	scene 
		(contains data/scans that will be edited)
	source 
		(contains original brain scans. This folder won't be touched 
		so that you don't lose the scans)
