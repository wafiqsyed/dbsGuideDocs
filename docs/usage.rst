How to use DBS Guide
=====================

The following section is a tutorial that explains how to use DBS Guide. Provided are two sections, **Surgery Walk-through** and **Widgets**. We recommend you to start with **Surgery Walk-through** as it will explain how to use DBS Guide at each phase of the surgery (pre/intra/post-operation). **Widgets** is a great reference that explains how to use each widget. 
Start with :ref:`Pre-op <Preop>`

.. note::
	Make sure to install 3D Slicer and DBS Guide. Visit our :ref:`installation tutorial <Installation>`.
